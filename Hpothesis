The parameter comparison between BERT and DistilBERT is as follows:

Model	Number of Parameters	Reduction in Parameters	Size Reduction
BERT-base	110 million	-	-
DistilBERT	66 million	44 million fewer	40% smaller


DistilBERT achieves this reduction by halving the number of layers (6 instead of 12) and leveraging techniques like knowledge distillation while retaining about 97% of BERT's performance

Hypothesis Testing: Definitions, Techniques, and Python Code

Hypothesis testing provides a structured approach to making statistical inferences about populations based on sample data

Key Definitions
Null Hypothesis (H0): A statement asserting that there is no effect or difference in the population. It serves as the default assumption to be tested.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha): This hypothesis represents what you aim to prove, suggesting that there is an effect or a difference.

=====================================================Hypothesis Testing=====================================================


P-value: The probability of observing the test results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.

Significance Level (α): A threshold set by the researcher (commonly 0.05) below which the null hypothesis is rejected.

Steps in Hypothesis Testing
Formulate Hypotheses: Define both the null and alternative hypotheses.

Collect Data: Gather data through appropriate sampling methods.

Choose a Statistical Test: Select a test based on data type and distribution.

Calculate the Test Statistic: Compute a statistic that reflects how much the observed data deviates from the null hypothesis.

Determine the P-value: Calculate the p-value associated with the test statistic.

Make a Decision: Compare the p-value to α:

If p ≤ α (p≤α: Reject H0.)

If p > α
(p>α: Fail to reject H0.)

Report Results: Present findings, including test statistics and p-values.

Common Hypothesis Testing Techniques
1. T-Test
The t-test is used to compare means between two groups when sample sizes are small and population variance is unknown.

Types of T-Tests:
Independent T-Test: Compares means from two different groups.

Paired T-Test: Compares means from the same group at different times.

Python Code for T-Test
python
import scipy.stats as stats

# Independent T-Test   
group1 = [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]
group2 = [30, 31, 32, 33, 34]
t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(group1, group2)
print("Independent T-Test:")
print("T-Statistic:", t_statistic)
print("P-Value:", p_value)

# Paired T-Test
before = [20, 21, 22, 23, 24]
after = [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]
t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_rel(before, after)
print("\nPaired T-Test:")
print("T-Statistic:", t_statistic)
print("P-Value:", p_value)

2. Z-Test
The z-test is used when comparing means with large samples (n > 30) or known population variance.

Python Code for Z-Test
python
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.stats.weightstats import ztest

data = [50, 52, 55, 57, 58]
population_mean = 50
z_statistic, p_value = ztest(data, value=population_mean)
print("\nZ-Test:")
print("Z-Statistic:", z_statistic)
print("P-Value:", p_value)

=====================================================Hypothesis Testing=====================================================

3. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
Used to compare means across three or more groups. ANOVA is appropriate when you have continuous data and multiple groups to compare.

Python Code for ANOVA
python
import scipy.stats as stats

group1 = [20, 21, 22]
group2 = [30, 31, 32]
group3 = [40, 41, 42]
f_statistic, p_value = stats.f_oneway(group1, group2, group3)
print("\nANOVA:")
print("F-Statistic:", f_statistic)
print("P-Value:", p_value)

=====================================================Hypothesis Testing=====================================================

4. Chi-Square Test
A chi-square test is used to compare the count of observations in two or more categories or groups. It is used to test the independence of two categorical variables.
For example, you can use a chi-square test to determine if there is a relationship between gender and political affiliation. It is appropriate when you have categorical data and you want to determine if there is a relationship between two variables.

Python Code for Chi-Square Test
python
import scipy.stats as stats

data = [[10, 20], [30, 40]]
chi2_statistic, p_value, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(data)
print("\nChi-Square Test for Independence:")
print("Chi-Square Statistic:", chi2_statistic)
print("P-Value:", p_value)
print("Degrees of Freedom:", dof)
print("Expected Frequencies:\n", expected)

Conclusion
Hypothesis testing provides a structured approach to making statistical inferences about populations based on sample data. By following defined steps and employing various tests like t-tests, z-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA in Python code examples above, researchers can draw meaningful conclusions from their analyses. Each test has specific conditions under which it should be applied to ensure valid results that inform decision-making processes in research and practice.
