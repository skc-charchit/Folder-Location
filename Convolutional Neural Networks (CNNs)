Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Definition: CNNs are a type of neural network designed to process data with grid-like topology, such as images. They are particularly effective in image recognition and classification tasks.

Steps in a CNN:
Convolutional Layer

Definition: This layer applies filters (kernels) to small regions of the input image, scanning the entire image to generate feature maps.

Process: The kernel slides over the image, performing a dot product at each position to detect features like edges or textures.

Padding: Often used to maintain the spatial dimensions of the input data by adding zeros around the edges. This helps in preserving the information at the borders.

Activation Function (e.g., ReLU)

Definition: Introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns.

Process: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) sets all negative values to zero, enhancing the model's ability to generalize.

Pooling Layer

Definition: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, retaining key features and reducing computational complexity.

Process: Commonly uses max or average pooling, where each region of the feature map is downsampled to a single value.

Flattening Layer

Definition: Converts the output of convolutional and pooling layers into a one-dimensional vector.

Process: Prepares the data for fully connected layers by transforming it into a linear format.

Fully Connected Layers

Definition: These layers are used for classification or regression tasks.

Process: The flattened data is passed through one or more fully connected layers to produce the final output.

Output Layer

Definition: Provides the final prediction based on the task (e.g., classification using Softmax).

Process: For classification tasks, Softmax is often used to output probabilities for each class.

Additional Concepts:
Stride: The number of pixels the kernel moves over when scanning the image.

Depthwise Separable Convolutions: A technique that separates the convolution into two steps: depthwise convolution (applied separately to each channel) and pointwise convolution (a standard convolution with a kernel size of 1x1).

Key Features of CNNs:
Local Connectivity: Each neuron processes data only from a small region (receptive field).

Shared Weights: Filters are replicated across the entire input, reducing parameters and enhancing translational invariance.

Hierarchical Feature Extraction: CNNs learn features from simple to complex by stacking multiple layers.

Example Architecture:
Input Layer: Image (224x224x3)

Convolutional Layer: 32 filters, kernel size 3x3, padding 1, stride 1

ReLU Activation

Max Pooling: 2x2, stride 2

Flattening

Fully Connected Layers: Two layers with 128 and 10 neurons respectively

Output Layer: Softmax for classification
